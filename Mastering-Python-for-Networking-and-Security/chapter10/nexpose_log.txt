Severity: 7
Title: RHSA-2014:0920: httpd security update
Description: 
The httpd packages provide the Apache HTTP Server, a powerful, efficient,and extensible web server.A race condition flaw, leading to heap-based buffer overflows, was found inthe mod_status httpd module. A remote attacker able to access a status pageserved by mod_status on a server using a threaded Multi-Processing Module(MPM) could send a specially crafted request that would cause the httpdchild process to crash or, possibly, allow the attacker to executearbitrary code with the privileges of the "apache" user. (CVE-2014-0226)A denial of service flaw was found in the way httpd's mod_deflate modulehandled request body decompression (configured via the "DEFLATE" inputfilter). A remote attacker able to send a request whose body would bedecompressed could use this flaw to consume an excessive amount of systemmemory and CPU on the target system. (CVE-2014-0118)A denial of service flaw was found in the way httpd's mod_cgid moduleexecuted CGI scripts that did not read data from the standard input.A remote attacker could submit a specially crafted request that would causethe httpd child process to hang indefinitely. (CVE-2014-0231)All httpd users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, whichcontain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing theupdated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

Description: 
Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to supportthe cross-platform development of security-enabled client and serverapplications. Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) provides platformindependence for non-GUI operating system facilities.A race condition was found in the way NSS verified certain certificates.A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an application using NSS or,possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user runningthat application. (CVE-2014-1544)A flaw was found in the way TLS False Start was implemented in NSS.An attacker could use this flaw to potentially return unencryptedinformation from the server. (CVE-2013-1740)A race condition was found in the way NSS implemented session tickethandling as specified by RFC 5077. An attacker could use this flaw to crashan application using NSS or, in rare cases, execute arbitrary code with theprivileges of the user running that application. (CVE-2014-1490)It was found that NSS accepted weak Diffie-Hellman Key exchange (DHKE)parameters. This could possibly lead to weak encryption being used incommunication between the client and the server. (CVE-2014-1491)An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in NSPR. A remote attacker couldpotentially use this flaw to crash an application using NSPR or, possibly,execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running thatapplication. This NSPR flaw was not exposed to web content in any shippedversion of Firefox. (CVE-2014-1545)It was found that the implementation of Internationalizing Domain Names inApplications (IDNA) hostname matching in NSS did not follow the RFC 6125recommendations. This could lead to certain invalid certificates withinternational characters to be accepted as valid. (CVE-2014-1492)Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting theCVE-2014-1544, CVE-2014-1490, CVE-2014-1491, and CVE-2014-1545 issues.Upstream acknowledges Tyson Smith and Jesse Schwartzentruber as theoriginal reporters of CVE-2014-1544, Brian Smith as the original reporterof CVE-2014-1490, Antoine Delignat-Lavaud and Karthikeyan Bhargavan as theoriginal reporters of CVE-2014-1491, and Abhishek Arya as the originalreporter of CVE-2014-1545.In addition, the nss package has been upgraded to upstream version 3.16.1,and the nspr package has been upgraded to upstream version 4.10.6. Theseupdated packages provide a number of bug fixes and enhancements over theprevious versions. (BZ#1112136, BZ#1112135)Users of NSS and NSPR are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,which correct these issues and add these enhancements. After installingthis update, applications using NSS or NSPR must be restarted for thisupdate to take effect.

Description: 
The libvirt library is a C API for managing and interacting with thevirtualization capabilities of Linux and other operating systems.In addition, libvirt provides tools for remote management ofvirtualized systems.It was found that libvirt passes the XML_PARSE_NOENT flag when parsing XMLdocuments using the libxml2 library, in which case all XML entities in theparsed documents are expanded. A user able to force libvirtd to parse anXML document with an entity pointing to a file could use this flaw to readthe contents of that file; parsing an XML document with an entity pointingto a special file that blocks on read access could cause libvirtd to hangindefinitely, resulting in a denial of service on the system.(CVE-2014-0179)Red Hat would like to thank the upstream Libvirt project for reporting thisissue. Upstream acknowledges Daniel P. Berrange and Richard Jones as theoriginal reporters.This update also fixes the following bugs:Users of libvirt are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, whichfix these bugs.

(CVE-2014-0118)  A denial of service flaw was found in the way httpd's mod_cgid module executed CGI scripts that did not read data from the standard input. A remote attacker could submit a specially crafted request that would cause the httpd child process to hang indefinitely. (CVE-2014-0231)  All httpd24-httpd users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

Description: 
Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to supportthe cross-platform development of security-enabled client and serverapplications. Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) provides platformindependence for non-GUI operating system facilities.A race condition was found in the way NSS verified certain certificates.A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an application using NSS or,possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user runningthat application. (CVE-2014-1544)A flaw was found in the way TLS False Start was implemented in NSS.An attacker could use this flaw to potentially return unencryptedinformation from the server. (CVE-2013-1740)A race condition was found in the way NSS implemented session tickethandling as specified by RFC 5077. An attacker could use this flaw to crashan application using NSS or, in rare cases, execute arbitrary code with theprivileges of the user running that application. (CVE-2014-1490)It was found that NSS accepted weak Diffie-Hellman Key exchange (DHKE)parameters. This could possibly lead to weak encryption being used incommunication between the client and the server. (CVE-2014-1491)An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in NSPR. A remote attacker couldpotentially use this flaw to crash an application using NSPR or, possibly,execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running thatapplication. This NSPR flaw was not exposed to web content in any shippedversion of Firefox. (CVE-2014-1545)It was found that the implementation of Internationalizing Domain Names inApplications (IDNA) hostname matching in NSS did not follow the RFC 6125recommendations. This could lead to certain invalid certificates withinternational characters to be accepted as valid. (CVE-2014-1492)Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting theCVE-2014-1544, CVE-2014-1490, CVE-2014-1491, and CVE-2014-1545 issues.Upstream acknowledges Tyson Smith and Jesse Schwartzentruber as theoriginal reporters of CVE-2014-1544, Brian Smith as the original reporterof CVE-2014-1490, Antoine Delignat-Lavaud and Karthikeyan Bhargavan as theoriginal reporters of CVE-2014-1491, and Abhishek Arya as the originalreporter of CVE-2014-1545.In addition, the nss package has been upgraded to upstream version 3.16.1,and the nspr package has been upgraded to upstream version 4.10.6. Theseupdated packages provide a number of bug fixes and enhancements over theprevious versions. (BZ#1112136, BZ#1112135)Users of NSS and NSPR are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,which correct these issues and add these enhancements.

A user able to alter the QEMU disk image filesloaded by a guest could use either of these flaws to corrupt QEMU processmemory on the host, which could potentially result in arbitrary codeexecution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.(CVE-2014-0222, CVE-2014-0223)Multiple buffer overflow, input validation, and out-of-bounds write flawswere found in the way virtio, virtio-net, virtio-scsi, usb, and hpetdrivers of QEMU handled state loading after migration. A user able to alterthe savevm data (either on the disk or over the wire during migration)could use either of these flaws to corrupt QEMU process memory on the(destination) host, which could potentially result in arbitrary codeexecution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.(CVE-2013-4148, CVE-2013-4149, CVE-2013-4150, CVE-2013-4151, CVE-2013-4527,CVE-2013-4529, CVE-2013-4535, CVE-2013-4536, CVE-2013-4541, CVE-2013-4542,CVE-2013-6399, CVE-2014-0182, CVE-2014-3461)These issues were discovered by Michael S.

	  Description
	  SECURITY-125 (Combination filter Groovy script unsecured)
	  This vulnerability allows users with the job configuration
	    privilege to escalate his privileges, resulting in arbitrary code
	    execution to the master.
	  SECURITY-162 (directory traversal from artifacts via symlink)
	  This vulnerability allows users with the job configuration
	    privilege or users with commit access to the build script to
	    access arbitrary files/directories on the master, resulting in
	    the exposure of sensitive information, such as encryption keys.
	  SECURITY-163 (update center metadata retrieval DoS attack)
	  This vulnerability allows authenticated users to disrupt the
	    operation of Jenkins by feeding malicious update center data into
	    Jenkins, affecting plugin installation and tool installation.
	  SECURITY-165 (external entity injection via XPath)
	  This vulnerability allows users with the read access to Jenkins
	    to retrieve arbitrary XML document on the server, resulting in
	    the exposure of sensitive information inside/outside Jenkins.
	  SECURITY-166 (HudsonPrivateSecurityRealm allows creation of
	    reserved names)
	  For users using "Jenkins' own user database" setting, Jenkins
	    doesn't refuse reserved names, thus allowing privilege escalation.
	  SECURITY-167 (External entity processing in XML can reveal
	    sensitive local files)
	  This vulnerability allows attackers to create malicious XML
	    documents and feed that into Jenkins, which causes Jenkins to
	    retrieve arbitrary XML document on the server, resulting in the
	    exposure of sensitive information inside/outside Jenkins.
	  Severity
	  SECURITY-125 is rated critical. This attack can be
	    only mounted by users with some trust, but it results in arbitrary
	    code execution on the master.
	  SECURITY-162 is rated critical. This attack can be
	    only mounted by users with some trust, but it results in the
	    exposure of sensitive information.
	  SECURITY-163 is rated medium, as it results in the
	    loss of functionality.
	  SECURITY-165 is rated critical. This attack is
